# Deducto Macro Tool
This is a python tool/script made specifically for the purpose of speedrunning the game Deducto, however, it can be used elsewhere to manually edit your mouse and keyboard inputs to perform certain tasks.

In `macrotool.py` I've provided a small macro, with comments, to hopefully make the process more intuitive.

## How to use
1. Download the python file `macrotool.py`
2. Open in VSCode
3. Download the necessary modules (should see an error if you don't have them, if you don't, install via pip).
4. Change the hotkeys to your preferred choice
5. Edit the inputs
6. Run the file
7. Enjoy
